# sd_ocean

(master branch on github has the latest version of the mod)

work in progress ocean biome by sulusdacor

currently somewhat working with b18

current "problems":

	- can not receive traders via land (trade caravan pawngroupmaker error)
	
	- no rivers at all due to coast check (requires detour of listgeneration in WorldGenStep_Rivers -> GetCoastalWaterTiles(), only checks for ocean biomedef form vanilla)
