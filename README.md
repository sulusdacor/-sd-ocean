# sd_ocean

work in progress ocean biome by sulusdacor

currently somewhat working with a17

current "problems":
	- can not receive traders via land (trade caravan pawngroupmaker error)
	- no rivers at all due to coast check (requires detour of listgeneration in WorldGenStep_Rivers -> GetCoastalWaterTiles(), only checks for ocean biomedef form vanilla)
